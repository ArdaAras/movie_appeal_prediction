# movie_appeal_prediction
Designed a two-phase ML pipeline using AWS (S3, EMR, SageMaker, Bedrock, Athena), Spark, and Airflow to predict Sci-Fi genre appeal for movies, training an XGBoost model on SageMaker with sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings and enabling inference for movies with Airflow, queryable via Athena.
